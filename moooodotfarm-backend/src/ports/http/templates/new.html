        <p>
            If you want your cow added to the herd, email the URL of your <code>cow.txt</code> to
            <a href="mailto:boreq@0x46.net">boreq@0x46.net</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
            As some cows can be shy and other cows can be brave please clearly state whether the cow URL should be
            <strong>VISIBLE</strong> or <strong>CENSORED</strong>,
            and make sure the URL you send is <strong>NOT</strong> censored.
        </p>

        <p>
            Cows can change their minds at any time, so feel free to email whenever you want to switch whether the cow’s name is visible or censored.
        </p>

        <section>
            The website needs the uncensored URL to verify that <code>cow.txt</code> is present, but if you
            request the URL to be censored, the uncensored URL will never be made publicly accessible via any
            means. On a completely unrelated note moooo.farm tracks all security incidents as
            <a href="/cves">Cow Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs)</a>.
